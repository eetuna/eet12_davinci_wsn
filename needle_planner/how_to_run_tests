roslaunch dvrk_model derlin_davinci_gazebo.launch

select point via Peng's node, or manually publish a point, e.g.:
  rostopic pub  /thePoint geometry_msgs/Point  '{x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.12}'

planner node will respond;  can watch topic with: 
  rostopic echo exit_point_array

send data to trajectory planner; should be done by Peng's node with selection of exit point;
 publishes 2 points (entrance and exit) using geometry_msgs/Polygon to topic "/entrance_and_exit_pts"
 
 Can test manually by running this example (test) node:

rosrun needle_planner test_needle_plan_horiz_kvec
(will prompt for entrance-pt coords and for kvec_yaw; will compute exit pt and publish entrance/exit pts)
e.g., enter: x=0, y=0, z=0.12, yaw= 0.7

Can then try the result by running:
rosrun playfile_reader playfile_cameraspace gripper_poses_in_camera_coords.csp
